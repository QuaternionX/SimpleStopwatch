SimpleStopwatch is aimed to be a basic Stopwatch app for the Pebble.

The stopwatch app currently contains functionality for start, pause, resetting,
and holding information about laps.

Recently, the ability to save the current time has been added to the stopwatch,
meaning that the app can be closed and reopened without losing a beat!
